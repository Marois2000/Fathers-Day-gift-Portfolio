            <p>
              Welcome to my personal portfolio website! With a lifelong passion
              for construction and a wealth of experience, I have established
              myself as a distinguished construction supervisor. From the tender
              age of a little boy, I immersed myself in job sites, eagerly
              assisting my father with new additions to our home. This early
              exposure paved the way for my remarkable journey in the industry.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              At the age of 11, I embarked on my professional journey with Maple
              Leaf Construction, starting out by washing trucks. Over the course
              of an impressive 33 years, I not only acquired an extensive
              knowledge of construction but also forged invaluable relationships
              throughout New England's construction community. My tenure with
              Maple Leaf Construction was a testament to my dedication,
              expertise, and unwavering commitment to excellence.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Continuing my pursuit of excellence, I currently thrive as a
              valuable member of the Harvey Construction team. My vast
              experience, combined with a strong work ethic and meticulous
              attention to detail, consistently contribute to the success of
              each project I oversee. Beyond the construction site, I embody the
              qualities of a loving father, devoted son, and supportive brother.
              With my infectious personality and natural charisma, I
              effortlessly brighten any room, making me the life of the party
              and a true people person.
